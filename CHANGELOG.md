### BREAKING CHANGES

This version brings Mongo breaking changes from Mongo v4.4 to v5. Specially, if you are using some query (e.g. with `_q` parameter) no more supported by new Mongo version or new driver version, it will return an error.

Known limitation in this version:

- before, it would be possible to make a count using `$nearSphere` operator. This operator is not permitted by mongo v4.4 and mongo v5, so in this version the count with this filter will throw.

### Updated

  For example, for an integer `null` value is converted to `0`, for a string to `''` (empty string).

- Both the handlers of `/-/check-up` and `/-/healthz` route check the connection to Mongo.

## v1.2.0 (Jun 25, 2019)

### Added:

- Support for the CRUD_LIMIT_CONSTRAINT_ENABLED env variables to enable constraints on minimum,
  maximum and default values. New limits are: maximum 200, minimum 1 and default 25

## v1.1.0

Changes that have landed in master but are not yet released.

### Added:

- Support for patching array items. The `$set` command works properly on both primitive and `RawObject` item types, by using `array.$.replace` and `array.$.merge` as keys in the `$set` command object.
  This feature involves the following CRUD operations:
  - Patch by ID
  - Patch many
  - Patch bulk
- `array.$.replace` Replace entirely the query-matching array item with the content passed as value.
- `array.$.merge` Edits only the specified fields of the query-matching array item with the content passed as value.

See below for some sample cURLs for **/PATCH** _/books-endpoint/{:id}_ where `_q={"attachments.name": "John Doe", _st: "PUBLIC"}`

**Case Merge**

```
curl -X PATCH "http://crud-service:3000/books-endpoint/5cf83b600000000000000000?_q=%7B%22attachments.name%22%3A%20%22John%20Doe%22%7D&_st=PUBLIC" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ "$set": { "attachments.$.merge": { "name": "renamed attachment" } }}"

```

**Case Replace**

```
curl -X PATCH "http://crud-service:3000/books-endpoint/5cf83b600000000000000000?_q=%7B%22attachments.name%22%3A%20%22John%20Doe%22%7D&_st=PUBLIC" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ "$set": { "attachments.$.replace": { "name": "renamed attachment", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "state": "attached" } }}"
```
