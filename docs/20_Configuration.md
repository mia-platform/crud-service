# CRUD Service Configuration

This service can be added to your project by visiting Mia-Platform [Marketplace](../../marketplace/overview_marketplace.md) and creating a new microservice from the **CRUD Service** plugin.

## Configure a CRUD Service to use MongoDB CRUD section

In order to start using the MongoDB CRUD section, all you have to do is adding it from the Marketplace: all the ConfigMaps and environment variables it needs will be precompiled with no need to change them.

:::info
The CRUD Service supports custom CA certs. If you want to learn more about these certificates and how to configure them in your CRUD Service, visit [this page](../../development_suite/api-console/api-design/services#provide-a-ca-certificate-to-a-custom-service).

### ConfigMap

The CRUD Service default ConfigMap is mounted in `/home/node/app/collections`. You can freely choose its name during the service creation.

Furthermore, the ConfigMap is not editable, as it is fundamental for the MongoDB CRUD section to work. It is not possible to add files, edit the mountPath, or delete it.

However, you will find a link that will redirect you to **MongoDB CRUD** dedicated section where you can continue to configure your project [CRUDs](../../development_suite/api-console/api-design/crud_advanced.md). By doing so, you will automatically define the collections that will be handled by the service, which means that there is no need to add any configuration files.

## Environment variables

Below you can find all the environment variables that you can edit.

:::warning
Using `ALLOW_DISK_USE_IN_QUERIES` (either with `true` or `false` values) with a MongoDB version lower than 4.4 will make all the GET calls unusable since the MongoDB cluster will raise an error for the unrecognized option `allowDiskUse`.

It is also important to notice that starting from MongoDB v6.0 new server property [`allowDiskUseByDefault`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/parameters/#mongodb-parameter-param.allowDiskUseByDefault)
is introduced with its value set to `true` by default. Consequently, the default behavior for that MongoDB version
is that for queries with pipeline stages using more than 100 MB of memory to execute, the database automatically
write temporary files on disk to support those queries.  
This default behavior can be disabled for _all_ queries by setting `ALLOW_DISK_USE_IN_QUERIES` to `false`.

In case you want to use [Client Side Field Level Encryption](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-client-side-encryption/),
you should also include several specific Environment Variables, either you are using the [encryption with Google Platform Cloud](./30_Encryption_configuration.md#configure-csfle-with-the-google-cloud-platform-gcp)
or a [local key](./30_Encryption_configuration.md#configure-csfle-with-local-key).
