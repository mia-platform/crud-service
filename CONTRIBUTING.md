# Contribution Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project.

Please follow these guidelines for helping us to better address your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize 
your pull requests. There are many ways to contribute, from writing examples, improving the documentation, submitting
bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the module itself.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please read it and follow it
before contributing. If you find someone that is not respecting it please report its behaviour.

## How Can I Contribute

There are several ways to contribute. You can [fork the repository](#fork) and [propose a Pull Request](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-submit-a-pr), or you can start a discussion to report a bug, an indesired behavior of the application, or to simply suggest a feature.

Before opening a new thread, please verify whether there's already a discussion about the topic of your interest. You can find them:
- in the [issues tab](https://github.com/mia-platform/crud-service/issues);
- in the [official Mia Platform Community Discussion page](https://github.com/mia-platform/community/discussions?discussions_q=label%3A%22CRUD+Service%22);

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, or you notice something that should be modified or improved, you can do so in the *Issues* section.

Before doing that, please search if there isnâ€™t already a similar issue already open. If you find a similar issue
that is already closed, open a new one and include a link to it inside the body of the new one.

### Propose a New Feature

Before starting to implement a new feature, open the relative issue for starting an open discussion on where is can be
relevant and expose alternative solutions or potential pitfall that you can encounter. Fill all the information required
by the template.

#### Run your tests

Any update to the code must be tested properly. We can refer to the [Local Development section of the README](./README.md#local-development). Please make sure that any update you want to propose includes enough tests, and the old ones pass as well.

#### How to submit a PR

* Commits should follow standards: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g. `feat(core): Add new feature`)
* In the `Unreleased` section in CHANGELOG.md, compile the changelog adding the improvement added in the PR.
  Changelog should follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) standard.
